# Hangman-Game

This game is designed based off of the classic game "hangman". There are a total of three hidden words, and the user must use they keyboard to guess letters contained in each word. As the user presses the keys, they sort into correct and incorrect categories. The user has a maximum of 10 failed attempts at guessing the word before the game will end. In the event that the user guesses all of the letters in the word, they will be allowed to move on to the next.
